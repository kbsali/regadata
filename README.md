Regadata - Open Race Data
=========================

This is a web application deticated to gather and present Regatta's Data. I first started this project for following the Vend√©e Globe 2012.
It is composed of 4 main pages :

* an "about" page explaining the reason why this project was started and the list of available reports (rankings + sail's analysis' pages),
* a documentation page so developpers can easily build their own applications on top of the available Race Data,
* ranking pages giving a detailled overview of the ranking,
* sail's pages giving a detailed view about the selected sail (including graphs showing the evolution of the boat) + a comparison option allowing the user to compare 2 boats' evolution over the course of the race.

The data is stored in MongDb and then converted to different formats :
* json
* geojson
* kml

It also comes with a set of command line commands to :

* download official ranking' spreadsheet in XLS format
* convert those XLS files into JSON + GEOJSON + KML files
* automatically tweet about the latest ranking

Prepare New Regatta
-------------------

* Prepare csv with full list of skippers/boats + import to mongodb
 * `src/init/XXX-20XX.csv`
  * Random color generator : =DEC2HEX(RANDBETWEEN(0, 16^6), 6)
 * `mongoimport -d regatta -c XXX20XX_sails --type csv --file src/init/XXX-20XX.csv --headerline --drop`
* Add race details
 * `src/races.php`
* Create language files + adapt texts (if copied from previous language files) :
 * `src/locales/XXX20XX_en.yml`
 * `src/locales/XXX20XX_fr.yml`
